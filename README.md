> **歌詞登録ステータス：同期歌詞あり**

```lrc
[00:03.16] We were staying in Paris
[00:11.67] That's when I feel the greatest
[00:13.34] I made a wish on an eyelash
[00:15.31] Made a wish on elevens
[00:17.07] Made a wish on my birthday
[00:19.02] I want something just like this
[00:22.92] But I won't be sad for the sake of it
[00:25.85] But I won't be sad for the sake of it
[00:29.55] And now we're strangers again
[00:32.52] If we go down
[00:34.76] Let's show them we are better
